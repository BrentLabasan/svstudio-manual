# Pitch Transition and Vibrato

The pitch transition and vibrato settings in the Note Properties panel are meant for quickly setting up a rough pitch outline. The details are expected to be fine-tuned via the [Parameters Panel](../parameters/parameters-panel.md).

Pitch transition controls the part of pitch curve near note boundaries. Vibrato applies to the middle of a note.

The default values of the transition and vibrato sliders are determined by their respective settings in the Voice panel.

!!! note

    The vibrato created using these sliders produces a simple expression-based pattern. Other methods of creating vibrato such as [Auto Pitch Tuning](../ai-functions/auto-pitch-tuning.md) will create more complex vibrato patterns without using these settings.

### Other Vibrato Properties
**Phase** - The phase of the sine-wave-like vibrato at its beginning, relative to a full cycle.

**Frequency** - How fast the vibrato oscillates (cycles per second).

**Jitter** - How much natural pitch fluctuation is added to the pitch curve (non-AI singers only).
