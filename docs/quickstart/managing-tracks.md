# Managing Tracks

Tracks are displayed in the [arrangement](../workspace/arrangement.md) panel.

There are multiple ways to add a new track:

- Click the three-line icon to the left of the time axis
- Right click empty space below the existing tracks
- From the "Project" menu at the top of the application window
- Drag an instrumental (.wav or .flac) file into the arrangement

!!! note "Pro Feature - Track Limit"

    Synthesizer V Studio Basic is limited to 3 tracks. The pro edition removes this limitation.

!!! warning

    Using an instrumental file in mp3 format may result in desynchronized audio.
