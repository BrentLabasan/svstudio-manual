# Saving the Audio

The audio output can be exported to a wav file via the Render panel, accessible from the side menu.

Give your files a name, select the tracks to render, and press "Bounce to Files" to export in wav format.

Some additional format settings are also available, such as bit depth and sample rate.

!!! note "Pro Feature - Aspiration Output"

    Synthesizer V Studio Pro can isolate and export separate files for the vocal aspiration, allowing aspiration to be mixed differently in your DAW.
