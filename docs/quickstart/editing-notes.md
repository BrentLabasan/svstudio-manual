# Editing Notes

### Selecting Notes

Notes can be selected by clicking on them. To select multiple notes at once, use the pointer tool to drag a bounding box around them.

Select all notes in the current track or group with ++ctrl+a++.

Multiple notes can also be selected or deselected by clicking on them individually while holding ++ctrl++.

A continuous sequence of notes can be selected by clicking the first note, holding ++shift++, and clicking the last note.

### Modifying Notes

Notes can be moved by clicking and dragging them. If multiple notes are selected, the entire selection will be moved.

To change a note's duration, click and hold on the head or tail (left or right edge of the note) and drag to the desired length.

### Overlapping Notes

Output cannot be synthesized for notes that overlap. Overlapping notes will be disabled and will not produce any sound.

Resize the notes so that they do not overlap, and synthesized output will be restored. The end of one note should meet with the start of the next note, unless there is intended to be silence between them.
