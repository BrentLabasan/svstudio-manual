Multiple notes can also be selected or deselected by clicking on them individually while holding ++ctrl++.

A continuous sequence of notes can be selected by clicking the first note, holding ++shift++, and clicking the last note.

### Modifying Notes

Notes can be moved by clicking and dragging them. If multiple notes are selected, the entire selection will be moved.
