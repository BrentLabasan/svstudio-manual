!!! info "Notice"

    This website is a work in progress. Some sections may be incomplete.

Synthesizer V Studio is a singing synthesizer released in July 2020, with AI synthesis functions added in December of 2020.

This website serves as an unofficial user manual for Synthesizer V Studio, since the [official manual](https://synthesizerv.com/manual/) by Dreamtonics refers to the legacy version of the software from 2018.

For official instructional content for SynthV Studio, check the Dreamtonics [video tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmYtpIFKN5iKaUlB6mRGzFJ0SGRJgRIPz).
