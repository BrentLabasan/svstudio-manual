# About

This unofficial user manual was created in an attempt to provide an up-to-date set of documentation for Synthesizer V Studio. If you have any feedback, please contact Claire on the [official forums](https://forum.synthesizerv.com/u/claire/summary) or report any issues via a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/claire-west/svstudio-manual/issues/new).

Diagrams should be consistent with the following:

- 22pt Arial labels (black)
    - 16pt for longer text, though any longer text should be part of the markdown body and reference a numbered label
- 4px #FF0000 (red) lines and boxes
    - Where boxes would obscure important information, arrows can be used to indicate specific UI elements (4px red)
- White margin/background
- Labels are positioned to the sides or above/below, but not both within the same diagram
    - When labels are used, they should be placed in the margins, not overlaid on the application
    - The sides that do not contain labels may have a 10px white margin, but images with no labels at all should not have a margin unless they are side-by-side comparisons ([example](/ai-functions/ai-retakes/#pitch))
    - Labels may be staggered, but this should be avoided unless necessary ([example](workspace/arrangement.md))
- Labels are numbered where appropriate, with corresponding text descriptions below the diagram
    - When labels are to the sides, numbering begins top-to-bottom in the left margin, then continues top-to-bottom down the right margin ([example](workspace/layout.md))
    - When labels are above/below, numbering begins left-to-right along the top margin, then continues left-to-right along the bottom margin ([example](workspace/arrangement.md))
- Lines are vertical and horizontal where possible, and labels are not rotated
    - Arrows are vertical, horizontal, or at a 45Â° angle
- All base diagram files (non-flattened) are saved alongside the final png
    - The points above provide clear and readable diagrams, however if we change the guidelines later having the non-flattened files will mean we can just replaces the labels, lines, and boxes without needing to retake all the underlying screenshots
