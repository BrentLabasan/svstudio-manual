Diagrams should be consistent with the following:

- 22pt Arial labels (black)
    - 16pt for longer text, though any longer text should be part of the markdown body and reference a numbered label
- 4px #FF0000 (red) lines and boxes
- White margin/background
- Labels are positioned to the sides or above/below, but not both within the same diagram
    - When labels are used, they should be placed in the margins, not on top of the application
    - The sides that do not contain labels may have a 10px white margin, but images with no labels at all should not have a margin
    - Labels may be staggered, but this should be avoided unless necessary ([example](workspace/arrangement.md))
- Labels are numbered where appropriate, with corresponding text descriptions below the diagram
    - When labels are to the sides, numbering begins top-to-bottom in the left margin, then continues top-to-bottom down the right margin ([example](workspace/layout.md))
    - When labels are above/below, numbering begins left-to-right along the top margin, then continues left-to-right along the bottom margin ([example](workspace/arrangement.md))
- Lines are vertical and horizontal where possible, and labels are not rotated
- All base diagram files (non-flattened) are saved alongside the final png
